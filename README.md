# GEE_FrameworkForestFireDataset

## Repository Overview

This repository contains datasets and Jupyter notebooks focused on the analysis of forest fire occurrences in Peninsular Malaysia using data from 2001 to 2022. The analyses are intended to assess patterns and possibly predict future occurrences using current annual variables.

### Files and Descriptions

#### `ChatGPT-ConversationHistory.txt`
- **Description:** Contains the history of prompts used with ChatGPT + Noteable plugin to generate the Python code.
#### `ForestFireDataset_PeninsularMalaysia_Filtered.csv`
- **Description:** A filtered dataset focusing on "current annual" variables related to forest fire occurrences in Peninsular Malaysia from 2001 to 2022. 
- **Access Information:** The full, unfiltered dataset is available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10050852).

#### `Noteable_DatasetAnalysis_OriFromNoteable.ipynb`
- **Description:** The original Jupyter notebook generated using the Noteable plugin, containing the Python code for initial analysis.

#### `Noteable_DatasetAnalysis_RerunLocal.ipynb`
- **Description:** Contains the rerun of the original analysis code because the initial notebook did not save graphs and figures. This version includes all visual outputs embedded directly within the notebook for easier reference and review.

#### `Noteable_DatasetAnalysis_Verify.ipynb`
- **Description:** Contains verification code to double-check the analysis results obtained from Noteable. Crucial for ensuring the reproducibility and accuracy of the findings reported in the original analysis.
